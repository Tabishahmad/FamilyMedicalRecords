---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tabishahmad/FamilyMedicalRecords.git
```

2. **Open in Android Studio** (Arctic Fox or newer)

3. **Add your Gemini API Key**
- Add this to `local.properties`:
```properties
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
- And reference it in `build.gradle`:
```groovy
buildConfigField "String", "GEMINI_API_KEY", "\"${GEMINI_API_KEY}\""
```

4. **Run the app** on a real device or emulator

---

## 📷 AI Explanation Feature

1. User uploads an image or PDF.
2. App extracts text using ML Kit (for image) or PDF parser.
3. Text and prompt are sent to Gemini API.
4. User sees an easy-to-understand explanation.

---

## 🧠 Multi-User Data Separation *(To Be Added)*

Currently, the app is built for a **single user**. To support **multiple users**:

- Integrate Firebase Authentication
- Store all user data under their `userId`
- Update Room or Firebase DB logic to isolate:
  - Profiles: `users/{userId}/profiles`
  - Documents: `users/{userId}/documents`

> ✅ Developers are welcome to fork and add this capability.
